Listen, you just want to log something? or might just want to save and retrieve [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and perform basic operations on the data, like a database? Don't want to learn a big library to do that? You're in luck! Because loggd is aimed to solve all of these problems for you! Let me show you üòä
